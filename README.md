# FULLSTACK COURSE 1

 <br />
 <br />

## INTRODUCTION
My first GitHub repo!!

### Summary
Yeah so this is my first git repo and also my intro into the world of fullstack development
This Repository consists of the various tutorial snippets and web dev code that were covered in **"The Odin Project"** and **Free_code_camp** aand some of my own practise projects

However this repo **will not be public** as it consists mostly of unfinished works and parts of the projects that are written with the intention of learning the concepts.

The project aims to access and use the three primary tools of web development: **HTML**   **CSS**   **Javascript**

Initially the projects may be kept distinct and later on they maight be used together as per the project requirements, *further the projects may not be organized or stuctured appropriately as they are approached from an educational and experimental stand point*.

## HTML and HTML5
The basics and the foundation of any website HTML, in the first part I explore the topics related to the same a create a web page that includes few features of the same. 

The projects under this category will also be included in the same file and be routed through a common page as I start to solve and design them in time. 

Few important parts(syntax) to get started wih the construction of an HTML page are as follows. 
> Every web page must have the `index.html` as it the first file a server looks for when our page is accessed.
